def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}.")
3. Program to Reverse a String
Python

Copy code
string = input("Enter a string: ")
reversed_string = string[::-1]
print(f"The reversed string is: {reversed_string}")
These programs are beginner-friendly and cover basic concepts like conditionals, recursion, and string manipulation. Let me know if you'd like more examples or explanations! ðŸ˜Š
